# Show Siblings

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It superimposes a group of predefined glyphs in the background of your letters. This can be both pretty helpful in the beginning of a design as well as at intermediate progress where quick proof overview is needed. The degree of a desired match depends on each design, of course.

### Install

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Either:  
   Double click the `.glyphsReporter` file and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp to install.  
   Or:  
   Copy the `.glyphsReporter` into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`). You can use subfolders (e.g. to sort plugins by author) there.
3. Restart Glyphs.

##### Known issues

- Currently working on Cyrillic and Greek, as well as a Custom Parameter to set up italic construction for `a` and `g`.
- Removing a component doesn’t update the displayed layer in the group members until the .glyphs file is reopened.

# Show Siblings (free version)

*This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).*  

It superimposes a group of predefined glyphs in the background of your letters. This can be both pretty helpful in the beginning of a design as well as at intermediate progress where quick proof overview is needed. The degree of a desired match depends on each design, of course.

### Install

1. In *Window > Plugin Manager*, click on the *Install* button next to the *Show Siblings* entry. 
2. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use

When ever you need it, toggle `Show Siblings` from the *View* menu.

### Features:

- **More Script:** Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Thai, Khmer, Myanmar, Hangul, …
- **Twins:** Alternative glyphs like `.ssXX` or any other suffixes.
- **Movable siblings:** Perfectly position them behind the current glyph.
- **Match Highlighter:** If a node of the current glyph matches a background node, you’ll get visual feedback.
- **Drawing modes:**
    + Flat filled
    + Flat filled with outline
    + Outline only
    + Outline only with removed overlaps
- **Show nodes:** Toggle display all nodes of all siblings
- **Don’t show siblings:** Toggle display of siblings
- **Temporary sibling:** show *any* glyph in as a “sibling”. No need to paste actual glyphs or components into the background layer anymore. (And forgetting them there, cluttering your files.)
- **Open Tab** with all siblings.

##### Known issues of the free version

- Currently working on Cyrillic and Greek, as well as a Custom Parameter to set up italic construction for `a` and `g`.
- Removing a component doesn’t update the displayed layer in the group members until the .glyphs file is reopened.
